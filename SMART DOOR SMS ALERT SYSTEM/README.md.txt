# Smart Door, Gas and Power Alert System

## 📌 Description
This project is an Arduino-based safety system that detects door opening,
gas leakage, and power failure. It sends real-time SMS alerts to the user
using a GSM module.

## 🔧 Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- MQ2 Gas Sensor
- Reed Switch
- GSM Module (SIM900A)
- Buzzer
- LED
- Relay Module
- Power Supply

## ⚙️ Features
- SMS alert when door opens
- Gas detection with buzzer warning
- Emergency alert for high gas level
- Power failure and restoration alert
- Local alert using LED and buzzer

## 🧠 Design Thinking Approach
- Empathize: Identified real-life home safety problems
- Define: Need for real-time alert system
- Ideate: GSM-based SMS solution
- Prototype: Arduino-based working model
- Test: Threshold tuning to reduce false alarms
